# Weather App Based on Tutorial By [SomeTea Codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDdn3yrsyCQ)

This app displays the high and low, current temperature for the day, current type of weather, and an icon that lets you see the type of weather more clearly. I built this as an exercise to refresh my Bootstrap skills with vanilla React.

You can run this project by cloning it and running the `npm start` command.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
